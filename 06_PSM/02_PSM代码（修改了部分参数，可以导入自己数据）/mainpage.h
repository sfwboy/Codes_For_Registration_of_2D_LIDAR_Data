@section intro Introduction
PSM is a library for matching 2D laser ranger finder scans in their native
polar representation. The development of the library started while A. Diosi conducted 
his PhD studies at the Intelligent Robotics Research Centre of Monash Univerity 
under the supervision of Lindsay Kleeman. 

This library is still a work in progress. Many things need to be improved and there
are a few open questions remaing. 

To find out more about PSM, read our paper:

@section acknow Acknowledgments
Thanks to Alan Zhang for pointing out bugs in the code and for suggesting
improvements (which still have not been incorporated into the 
code). Thanks to Mohsen Akbaritabar for having provided a dataset 
for the Hokuyo UTM.
