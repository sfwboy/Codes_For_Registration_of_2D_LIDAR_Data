    comments             : - range units are cm; angle units are radians or degrees
                           - the laser is on the robot's Y axis
                           - in scan projections, occluded ref scanpoints are not removed!
                           - TODO: Investigate why is checking the range difference necessary for
                            the Hokuyo UTM and not for the rest.
