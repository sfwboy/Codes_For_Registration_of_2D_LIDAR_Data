polar_matching is an implementation of the Polar Scan Matching (PSM)
approach for matching 2D laser scans and can be downloaded at
www.irrc.monash.edu.au/adiosi. More about PSM can be found in:

A. Diosi and L. Kleeman, "Fast Laser Scan Matching using Polar Coordinates",
Published in 2007 in IJRR

A. Diosi and L. Kleeman, "Laser Scan Matching in Polar Coordinates
with Application to SLAM " Proceedings of 2005 IEEE/RSJ International
Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, August, 2005, Edmonton,
Canada

Code for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is not
distributed in this package. This package contains only the laser scan
matching approach PSM (and ICP for comparison) and example code.
PSM has been tested with Sick LMS 200, Hokuyo URG-04LX and Hokuyo
UTM-30LX scans. There are big performance reserves in the
implementation as the code has not been optimized yet. polar_matching
is still a work in progress.

The latest version of polar_matching has been tested on the 64 bit
version of Ubuntu 15.04. The drawing part of polar_matching requires X11,
therefore it will not work under non-Unix OS. However the core of scan
matching possibly compiles under other operating systems with little
extra work.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

In a Linux console unzip polar_matching_vX.zip by typing
"unzip polar_matching_vX.zip". Go into the directory polar_matching
by typing "cd polar_matching". Compile the library and test program
by typing "make all". Then run the example program "./example" or run
the unit tests "./run_test".



I hope that despite the weak documentation and hard to read coding,
polar_matching will be useful to someone. If you have got any
questions or comments please write me an email with PSM on the
subject line. I'll may be able to help. When you find pairs of
scans where PSM fails while it should not, please send them my
way as it may help me to improve PSM.

Change Log
  03/08/2015- Version 0.31 released. It contains only minor changes. In
              Makefile, the order of libraries were swapped to enable linking
              using recent versions of the GNU linker. draw.c has been
              changed to speed up drawing. Until now, prior drawing an
              element, its colour was searched for and set accordingly which
              took a lot of time. In v0.31 the colour search is only performend
              if the element's colour differs from the previous one's.
              Big thanks to David Zh, who pointed out a bug in polar_match.cpp:
              PM_DFI = PM_FOV*PM_D2R/ ( PM_L_POINTS + 1.0 ) was corrected to:
              PM_DFI = PM_FOV*PM_D2R/ ( PM_L_POINTS - 1.0 ).


  2006-2010 - Works with a number of laser scanners. Removed unused code.
              Removed psm_c to lessen the work needed for maintenance.
              Moved psm into a library. Changed ICP's scan projection to that of PSM
              to reduce programming time needed to make it work with generic scans.
              Changed the license to BSD. Added an example. Improved documentation.
              There also is a minor interface change: the scan preprocessing
              functions are no longer accessible separately.
              Use pm_preprocessScan instead.

  04/11/2005- bug fixed in pm_is_corridor. Bug pointed out by Alan Zhang
